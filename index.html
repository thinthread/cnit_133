			<h4>Stephanie Boyette</h4>
			<main>

				<p>
					My name is Stephanie, and I am a mixed-media artist with an emphasis on photography. 
					I am passionate about programming, and am on track to becoming a full-stack engineer.  While attending
					Hackbright (a women's bootcamp that focuses on full-stack engineering, and uses such tech langiages/ 
					tools as Python, Flask, PSQL and more), I realized that fine art and programming are not so different 
					after all.  Both involes creative thinking and constant innovative problem solving.  While interning at
					HireClub as a full-stack engineer as well as staff photographer, and intering at CCSF as a Data Security 
					Analyst, my love of programming intensified.  I am anticipating completing a CS degree, and beginning a 
					career as a full-stack engineer after earning an AS degree and Web Development Certificate.  I am  
					looking forward to bringing my unique, artistic vision to the world of programming.
